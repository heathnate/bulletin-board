This project was completed as the final project of CS4065 - Computer Networks and Networked Computing.
I used Java, paired with functional programming and OOP concepts, to implement a client and server for the bulletin board.

PROGRAM COMPILATION/RUN INSTRUCTIONS
    1. In order to run Java within VS Code - our preferred method - you must have a JDK installed. If you don't already have one, you can find more information about it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java
    2. Next, right click the ZIP folder submission in your File Explorer and extract them to a separate, unzipped folder.
    3. Open VSCode and open the newly created folder using the "File" option in the top left.
    4. Run the Server.java file first by either clicking the Run button in the top right or enter the following:
        "javac Server.java"
        "java Server"
    5. Now, run the Client.java file by either clicking the Run button in the top right or enter the following:
        "javac Client.java"
        "java Client"
    6. For testing multiple connected clients, simply run the Client.java file multiple times with the server running.
